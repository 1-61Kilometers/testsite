                    <div class="accordion-header">What constitutes a mental health crisis?</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>A mental health crisis refers to any situation in which a person's behavior, emotions, or psychological state puts them at risk of harming themselves or others, or prevents them from being able to care for themselves or function effectively in the community. This may include suicidal thoughts or behaviors, acute psychosis, severe depression or anxiety, trauma reactions, or significant changes in behavior due to substance use or mental illness. If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, our community stabilization services can provide immediate assessment, intervention, and support to address the crisis and develop a plan for ongoing care and recovery.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>The duration of community stabilization services varies depending on individual needs, the nature and severity of the crisis, and the person's response to intervention. Typically, acute crisis stabilization services may last from a few days to a couple of weeks, focusing on addressing immediate safety concerns, reducing symptoms, and connecting individuals with appropriate ongoing care. Throughout the stabilization process, our team continuously assesses progress and works collaboratively with clients and their support systems to determine the appropriate next steps in their care journey. Our goal is to provide the right level of support for the right amount of time, ensuring a smooth transition to less intensive services when the individual is ready.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>After the initial crisis has been stabilized, we work closely with each individual to develop a comprehensive discharge and follow-up plan. This plan typically includes referrals to appropriate levels of ongoing care, such as outpatient therapy, medication management, support groups, or community resources. We also focus on identifying and addressing factors that contributed to the crisis, developing coping strategies and safety plans, and strengthening support systems to prevent future crises. Our care coordinators maintain contact with clients during the transition period to ensure they successfully connect with ongoing services and have the support they need to maintain stability. We believe that effective crisis stabilization is not just about addressing immediate concerns but also about laying the foundation for long-term recovery and well-being.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>With the client's consent, we actively involve family members or other support persons in the stabilization process, recognizing their important role in providing support and promoting recovery. Family involvement may include participating in assessment and treatment planning discussions, learning about the nature of the client's mental health challenges, developing skills to support their loved one, and connecting with resources for family members. We offer family education sessions, supportive counseling, and guidance on creating a supportive home environment. We also help families understand the importance of maintaining their own well-being while supporting their loved one. Our approach is collaborative and strengths-based, respecting both the individual's autonomy and the value of supportive relationships in the recovery process.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Yes, we accept most major insurance plans for our community stabilization services, including Medicare, Medicaid, and many private insurance plans. Our administrative team works diligently to verify benefits and obtain necessary authorizations prior to or during service delivery. We understand that navigating insurance coverage during a crisis can be overwhelming, so we handle much of this process for our clients. For individuals without insurance or with limited coverage, we offer information about financial assistance programs, sliding fee scales, and other options to make services accessible. Our priority is ensuring that individuals in crisis receive the care they need, regardless of financial circumstances. We encourage you to contact our intake department for specific information about coverage and costs.</p>
