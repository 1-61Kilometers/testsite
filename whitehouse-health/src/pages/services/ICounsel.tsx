      title: 'How do I know if iCounsel is right for me?',
      content: 'iCounsel is designed to support individuals, couples, and families experiencing a wide range of mental health concerns and life challenges. Our services may be beneficial if you\'re struggling with anxiety, depression, stress, relationship difficulties, grief, trauma, life transitions, or simply seeking personal growth. During an initial consultation, we can discuss your specific needs and determine whether our services are a good fit or if another type of support might be more appropriate.'

      title: 'What can I expect during my first counseling session?',
      content: 'Your first session, often called an intake appointment, focuses on gathering information about your current concerns, relevant history, and goals for counseling. Your counselor will explain the counseling process, discuss confidentiality and practice policies, and answer any questions you may have. This initial session helps establish rapport and allows your counselor to begin understanding your unique situation. Together, you\'ll start developing a plan for addressing your concerns. Keep in mind that building a therapeutic relationship takes time, and it\'s normal for the first session to feel different from subsequent sessions.'
    },
    {
      title: 'How long does counseling typically last?',
      content: 'The duration of counseling varies depending on your specific concerns, goals, and progress. Some people benefit from short-term, solution-focused therapy addressing specific issues, which might involve 6-12 sessions. Others find value in longer-term support for complex or chronic concerns. Your counselor will discuss recommendations for treatment duration based on your needs, and together you\'ll regularly evaluate progress and adjust the plan as needed. Remember that counseling is not a lifetime commitmentâ€”our goal is to help you develop the skills and insights needed to navigate challenges effectively on your own.'
    },
    {
      title: 'Is what I share in counseling confidential?',
      content: 'Confidentiality is a cornerstone of effective counseling. Information shared during sessions is kept confidential within the bounds of legal and ethical guidelines. There are specific limitations to confidentiality that your counselor will discuss with you during your first session, including situations involving danger to self or others, abuse or neglect of vulnerable populations, and certain legal proceedings. These exceptions are designed to ensure safety and comply with legal requirements. Outside of these specific circumstances, your personal information and the content of your sessions remain private and protected.'
    },
    {
      title: 'Does iCounsel accept insurance?',
      content: 'Yes, iCounsel accepts many major insurance plans, including Medicare, Medicaid, and various private insurance providers. Our administrative team can verify your benefits prior to your first appointment and explain any applicable co-payments, coinsurance, or deductibles. If you don\'t have insurance coverage or prefer not to use insurance, we also offer reasonable self-pay rates and can discuss payment options. We\'re committed to making mental health care accessible and will work with you to address financial considerations.'
